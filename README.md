Welcome to my biggest project with React!
Perview: https://candid-dieffenbachia-d53a1b.netlify.app

Few Steps to start the project local:
In terminal
1. run "npm i" 
2. run "npm start" 

The project is with self drawing SVG Logo, but because of copyright I remove it from the perview!
You can view it when the project is runned locally, also i will drop photos of the logo below.
